### Course Description
From ATMs to kiosks to art installations, software applications drive a diverse range of interactive experiences in the connected world. This course explores the processes and challenges of designing interfaces and data visualizations for human gestures. Students will work in groups to ideate, design, develop and fabricate an installation piece over the course of the semester. An emphasis will be placed on collaborative visual and information design in combination with leveraging agile methodologies and open source solutions. Projects will undergo user group testing to encourage an iterative process.

--

### Learning Outcomes
Students will:

* Learn concepts and benefits of an iterative design and development process
* Implement agile methodologies for development and leverage issue/project tracking software
* Capture, harvest and reconcile interaction feedback from users and user groups; incorporate findings into evolution of project application design and functionality
* Learn how to implement webviews in application wrappers and frameworks

### Schedule
##### Week 1 | 2/4 - Introduction

The syllabus will be reviewed in detail along with a discussion of core class concepts and an overview of technical tools and techniques to be learned and used over the course of the semester. 

Time will be spent to introduce the students to the instructor and his work. Students will introduce themselves and speak to what they expect to glean from the course.

Students will sketch and visualize ideas on what their ideal interactive physical application would entail; an open discussion of those concepts and inherent expectations and possibilities will follow.

---

Assignment #1: Visit one or more interactive applications around NYC and answer the following questions:

* What worked well from a usability perspective?
* What was elegant or beautiful from a visual or user design perspective?
* What was ineffective in any way and how would you go about changing it for the better?

Suggested locations to visit:

* MTA “On The Go” information kiosks**
* MTA MetroCard kiosks
* Bank ATMs
* Museum Exhibits
    * New Cooper Hewitt Experience
    * 9/11 Museum
    * New York Historical Society
    * MoMA

** There are actually two different versions of the “On The Go” kiosk: one by Control Group and one by CBS Outdoor. It may be interesting to observe and interact with both and note similarities and differences between the two builds.

##### Week 2 | 2/11 - Designing Interactions
Discuss results of Assignment #1 and whiteboard the various sites visited; capture the type of input methods each implements.

Overview of basic user event inputs and event types; the mouse and touch parallel, multi-touch, sensors, etc. Discussion of how to handle these events in an application and the problems that arise from real-world scenarios. 

Workshop 1: Simple photobooth web app example

Review brainstorming concepts from Week 1 and select the 3-4 most vialble concepts and discuss parameters of viability. 
Students will form into groups based on which of the 3-4 concepts they would like to work on most.

BREAK

Workshop 2: Daft Punk Konsole example. In groups, students will concept interesting ways to extend the Daft Punk Konsole and implement.

Case Study: RAA Media’s Interactive Multi-User Touch Table for the Eaton Experience Center

Assignment #2: Prototype a basic web application which reacts to a complicated user input to trigger a resulting behavior. The user input can be any combination of mouse interactions, touch interactions, gestures, or sequences. More elaborate executions can extend to keyboard input, or even leveraging cameras and sensors.

--

##### Week 3 | 2/18 - Development Platforms
Share and discuss applications created from Assignment #2. Discuss how to elaborate on functionality and purpose.

Workshop: Students will create a “matrix” of what specific behaviors to capture in their application prototype. A tracking system such as Flurry or Google Analytics will be overviewed.

Discussion of how application screens and components can be configured and integrated. Web Views and their use in kiosks will be discussed, along with the pros and cons of using web views in isolated and distributed systems. We will discuss using Kiosk mode for Chrome applications, node webkit and Cocoa applications as web view wrappers. 

---

Assignment #3: Expand on the web app created in Assignment #2 to add tracking and metrics capturing, and have the app used and tested. Plan, provision and execute a simple deployment option to allow application interaction and therefore capture meaningful data. 

--

##### Week 4 | 2/25 - Collaboration
Share analytics and metrics gathered from Assignment #3. Discuss how that data could be used to iterate on an interaction concept.

Best practices for version control and shared assets/resources and project architecture will be discussed and tools for creative and functional collaboration will be introduced and set up.

Workshop: Students will be assigned into smaller teams to begin concept and strategy work behind their project for the semester.

---

Assignment #4: Requirements Gathering. Project Teams will work collaboratively to define sets for application usability, functional requirements, technical requirements, hardware provisioning and assets gathering.

--

#####Week 5 | 3/4 - Project Pre-planning
Overview of Agile Methodologies for software development and an introduction to Redmine, the open source tracker software teams will use to manage their projects.

Workshop: set up Redmine with Agile plugins for each Project Team.

Project Teams will organize their application concept into user “stories” with attached “tasks” accordingly, and will delegate tasks by committee. Project plans will then be vetted with the professor to gauge feasibility within the 3-4 sprint development period.

---

Assignment #5: Project Teams to set up project schedule, assign team roles and establish milestones.

--

##### Week 6 | 3/6 - Project Sprint 1
Project Teams to begin work on application concepts and begin work on real-time design and development via rapid prototyping, incorporating lessons learned and code completed from previous assignments. 

--

##### Week 7 | 3/11 : Project Round Robin 1
Demo of in-progress applications to a sibling group. 
Findings and feedback to be remediated via Agile Development “Stories” and “Tasks”.

--

##### Week 8 | 3/25 : Pitch Preparation and Project Sprint 2
Guest speaker Alexander Rea, Co:Collective, to discuss the finer arts of pitch presentation (TBC).

Project Teams to continue work on applications and begin putting together key points for presentation. 

--

##### Week 9 | 4/1 : Project Round Robin 2
Demo of in-progress applications and presentations to a sibling group.

### Grading 
Assignments: 40% 

Final Project: 50% 

Course Participation: 10% 

Failing grades will be given to students who do not complete the final project. Poor performance may result in failing as well.

--

### Attendance
Class attendance is required; more than two unexcused absences will result in a failing grade. Tardiness of more than 10 minutes without advance prior notification will count as an absence.

--

### Assignments
Assignments also serve as tutorials -- lessons learned as well as actual code completed from these exercises can and should be applied to the final course project. Failing to complete the assignments will not necessarily result in failing, but will potentially create additional work in the long run.

--

### Office Hours 
There are no set office hours but the professor is available to meet with students directly by appointment before or after class. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you need help!
